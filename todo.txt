1. Add docs, for the love of godes
- Yes this can be worked on

2. Could use bagging - use different ways of filling in the missing values, train and treat them as separate models?

3. Boosting - write adaboost, idk how well it would work with this.
- What's the accuracy right now? We should have a good reason to implement a feature.

4. What about data visualization, all the data science stuffs. Is it important?
